Amazon Web Services' Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) service that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications. It provides a managed environment to run your applications on various AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, and Amazon CloudWatch, among others.

Elastic Beanstalk allows you to upload your application's source code or artifact and automatically handles the deployment and provisioning of the necessary resources to run it. It supports multiple programming languages, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Go, allowing you to develop your application in the language of your choice.

<details><summary> <h3>Terms and Concepts</h3></summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Application:</b> An application in Elastic Beanstalk represents your web application that will be deployed and run on the service.</li>
<li><b>Environment:</b> An environment in Elastic Beanstalk is a collection of resources that support the deployment and execution of your application, including EC2 instances, databases, load balancers, and network configurations.</li>
<li><b>Version:</b> A version in Elastic Beanstalk represents a build or artifact of your application that can be deployed and run in an environment.</li>
<li><b>Configurations:</b> Elastic Beanstalk configurations are configuration files that specify how your application should be deployed and run, including environment settings, scalability options, load balancer configurations, and more.</li>
<li><b>Environments:</b> An environment is an instance of a specific environment, representing an isolated deployment of your application in a development, testing, or production environment.</li>
<li><b>Environment URL:</b> Each environment in Elastic Beanstalk has a unique assigned URL that allows access to your deployed application on the web.</li>
<li><b>Environment Tier:</b> Elastic Beanstalk offers two environment tiers: Web Server Environment and Worker Environment. The Web Server Environment is used for traditional web applications, while the Worker Environment is used for batch processing or message queue applications.</li>
<li><b>Domains:</b> Elastic Beanstalk allows you to associate a custom domain with your environment so your application can be accessed using a custom URL.</li>
<li><b>Rolling:</b> Rolling is a feature of Elastic Beanstalk that allows you to gradually deploy a new version of your application to an environment, reducing the impact on ongoing operations.</li>
