Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web. It is designed to scale infinitely, enabling you to store and retrieve massive amounts of data with high availability and durability. Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well.

An S3 has one or more buckets, and each bucket contains zero or more objects.

An object is data of any type (txt, mp4, csv) with the following characteristics:

- Data: The object itself containing data.
- Metadata: Data about the data, a set of name-value pairs that can store information related to the object, such as type, format, and tags.
- Key: A name assigned to the object, used to retrieve the object.
- Value: The content stored in the object.

</div>

As mentioned, the object is stored inside the bucket:

</div>

In a simple analogy, you can compare a file in a folder on a hard drive to an object (file) in a bucket on S3:

</div>

Before uploading an object, you need to create the bucket, which is a container suitable for objects.

</details>
<details><summary> <h3>Terms and Concepts</h3></summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Buckets:</b> Containers for S3 objects. All objects are stored in a bucket. Before uploading objects, it is necessary to create a bucket.
   <ul>
      <li><b>Requirement:</b> Must have a globally unique name (across all regions, all accounts)</li>
      <li><b>Definition:</b> Buckets are defined at the region level</li>
      <li><b>Observation:</b> S3 appears to be a global service, but buckets are created in a region</li>
      <li><b>Naming Convention:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>No uppercase or underscore</li>
          <li>3-63 characters long</li>
          <li>Not an IP</li>
          <li>Must start with a lowercase letter or number</li>
          <li>Must NOT start with the prefix <b>xn--</b></li>
          <li>Must NOT end with the suffix <b>-s3alias</b></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Objects:</b> The data stored in S3 is called objects. Each object consists of data and metadata (information about the object).
  <ul>
    <li><b>Object values:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)</li>
        <li>If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Metadata:</b> (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)</li>
    <li><b>Tags:</b> (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle</li>
    <li><b>Version ID:</b> (if versioning is enabled)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Key:</b> An object's key is a unique identifier for that object in the bucket.
  <ul>
    <li>The key is the <b>FULL</b> path:
      <ul>
        <li>File: s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt</li>
        <li>Folder: s3://my-bucket/another_folder/my_file.txt</li>
      </ul>  
    </li>
    <li>The key is composed of <i>prefix</i> + <b>object name</b>
        <ul>
          <li>s3://my-bucket/<i>another_folder</i>/<b>my_file.txt</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you think otherwise)</li>
    <li>Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")</li>
  </ul> 
</li>
</li>
<li><b>Versions:</b> S3 stores all versions of objects that have been changed, allowing you to retrieve previous versions if necessary.
 <ul>
        <li>You can version your file in Amazon S3</li>
          <div align="center">
            <img src="https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/31/66/B9aqFg5w_t.png" width="25%"/>
          </div>
        <li>It is enabled at the <b>bucket level</b></li>
        <li>Same key overwrites will change the "version": 1, 2, 3...</li>
          <div align="center">
            <img src="https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/ea/d3/UI5BSw47_t.png" width="25%" />
          </div>
        <li>It is best practice to version your buckets
            <ul>
                <li>Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)</li>
                <li>Easy roll to the previous version</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Notes:
            <ul>
                <li>Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"</li>
                <li>Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<li><b>Replication:</b> this is a way to reply the content of a S3 to other S3, has two ways, the first is CCR (Cross Region Replication) and the second is SSR (Same-Region Replication)
      <div align="center">
            <img src="https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/fe/f6/CinoD172_t.png"/>
      </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Is necessary to set up asynchronous replication between these two buckets</li>
        <li>Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets</li>
        <li>Buckets can be in different AWS accounts</li>
        <li>Copying is asynchronous</li>
        <li>Must give proper IAM permissions to S3 (to read and write from specified buckets)
            <ul>
                <li>Use Cases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CRR: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts</li>
                        <li>SRR: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>  
</li>  
<li><b>Lifecycle:</b> S3 provides a way to manage the lifecycle of objects, allowing you to configure rules to automatically archive or delete objects based on their lifespan.</li>
<li><b>Storage Classes:</b> S3 offers various storage classes for objects, each with different durability, availability, and cost characteristics. Some questions that can be asked: How often will the data be retrieved? Does the data need to be highly or less available? Depending on the answer, a class can be selected:
      <hr>
      <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Storage Class</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Standard</td>
      <td>
        Designed for frequently accessed data. Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones. A good choice for use cases such as a website. More expensive, as it expects data to be accessed very frequently.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)</td>
      <td>
        Similar to S3 Standard, stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones. Ideal for data accessed infrequently. Lower storage and retrieval cost per GB.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)</td>
      <td>
        Lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA. Stores data in a single Availability Zone. Used when cost savings on storage are desired, and data can be easily reproduced in case of Availability Zone failure.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval</td>
      <td>
        Ideal for long-term data, rarely accessed but requiring quick retrieval (milliseconds). Offers access as fast as Standard and Standard-IA. Ideal for data accessed once per quarter. Minimum storage duration of 90 days
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval</td>
      <td>
        For data that does not require immediate access. Ideal for non-urgent backup usage, disaster recovery. The user can choose the retrieval speed. Ideal for data accessed 1 or 2 times per year. Expedited (1 to 5 minutes). Standard (3 to 5 hours). Bulk (5 to 12h)Minimum storage duration of 90 days
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Glacier Deep Archive</td>
      <td>
        Supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed 1 or 2 times per year. Ideal for companies needing to retain data for legal compliance for 7 to 10 years. Standard (12 hours). Bulk (48h). Minimum storage duration of 180 days
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S3 Intelligent-Tiering</td>
      <td>
        Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns. Automatically manages the lifecycle of stored objects, optimizing costs. Requires a small monthly fee for monitoring and automation per object.

<li><b>Encryption:</b> Exist two ways to use encrypt using S3 Server-Side and Client-Side
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Server-Side Encryption:</strong> So it is by default whenever you create a bucket or whenever you upload an object, it will be encrypted. When the user uploads an object into Amazon S3, and then that object, when it arrives in the bucket, is going to be encrypted by Amazon S3 for security purposes. The idea is that the server is doing the encryption, and therefore we call this server-side encryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> When the user will actually take the file, will encrypt it before uploading it, so the lock is done by the user, and then put it in the bucket. And that's called client-side encryption.
