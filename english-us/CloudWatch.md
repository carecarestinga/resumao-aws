Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides you with real-time metrics and logs from various AWS resources. It allows you to gain visibility into your applications, infrastructure, and services, and take actions based on the data you receive. CloudWatch can be used to monitor resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and more, and can trigger alerts based on the metrics you define.

<ul>
    <li><b>Real-time monitoring:</b> CloudWatch provides you with real-time metrics and logs from various AWS resources, allowing you to gain visibility into your applications, infrastructure, and services.</li>
    <li><b>Alerting:</b> CloudWatch allows you to define alarms based on metrics, and trigger actions based on the data you receive.</li>
    <li><b>Logs Management:</b> CloudWatch allows you to collect and analyze log data, and can be integrated with AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk.</li>
    <li><b>Dashboards:</b> CloudWatch provides you with customizable dashboards that allow you to visualize and monitor your resources in real-time.</li>
    <li><b>API and CLI:</b> CloudWatch can be accessed through the AWS Management Console, APIs, and CLI, allowing you to integrate it with your existing tools and workflows.</li>
</ul> 
</details>
<details><summary> <h3>Terms and Concepts</h3></summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Metrics:</b> A metric is a time-ordered set of data points that represent the values of a variable over time.</li>
<li><b>Namespaces:</b> A namespace is a container for CloudWatch metrics, and is used to group related metrics together.</li>
<li>
<b>Logs:</b> CloudWatch Logs is a service that enables you to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, and other cloud resources. 
</li>
<li><b>Log Groups:</b> A log group is a collection of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings.</li>
<li><b>Log Streams:</b> A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source, such as an EC2 instance or a Lambda function.</li>
<li><b>Alarms:</b> An alarm is a way to monitor a metric over time, and trigger actions based on the data you receive. You can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, or reboot EC2 instances, or send notifications to Amazon SNS topics.</li>
<li><b>Dashboard:</b> A dashboard is a collection of widgets that allow you to visualize and monitor your resources in real-time.</li>
</ul> 
</details>
<details><summary><h3>Best Practices</h3></summary>
<ul>
  <li>Configure CloudWatch alarms to notify you when specific thresholds are breached, such as CPU usage or network traffic</li>
  <li>Use CloudWatch Logs to store and monitor log data generated by your instances and applications, and to troubleshoot issues</li>
  <li>Enable detailed monitoring to collect metrics at a one-minute interval instead of the default five-minute interval, to have more granular data for analysis and troubleshooting</li>
  <li>Use CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize and monitor key metrics and trends for your resources in a single view, and share with stakeholders</li>
  <li>Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to CloudWatch resources based on the principle of least privilege</li>
  <li>Use CloudWatch Events to automate responses to events in your AWS environment, such as starting or stopping EC2 instances or triggering Lambda functions</li>
  <li>Configure CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries that monitor your endpoints and APIs, and alert you when they experience errors or latency issues</li>
  <li>Use CloudWatch Container Insights to monitor and troubleshoot containerized applications running on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
