Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed API management service that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure RESTful and WebSocket APIs. The API Gateway is scalable, secure, and can be used to expose your backend services, such as Lambda functions, to mobile, web, and external clients.

<details><summary> <h3>Terms and Concepts</h3></summary>
<ul>
<li><b>API:</b> An API is a set of definitions and protocols that allow communication between applications and services.</li>
<li><b>Endpoints:</b> An endpoint is a URL that represents a service, such as a Lambda function or an Amazon EC2 instance, and can be accessed through an API.</li>
<li><b>Integration:</b> An integration is a link between an API endpoint and a backend service such as a Lambda function or an Amazon EC2 instance.</li>
<li><b>Data model:</b> A data model is a definition of the data used in the API.</li>
<li><b>Resources:</b> A resource is an entity that is exposed by an API, such as an image, a product, or a user.</li>
<li><b>Gateway:</b> A gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients and services, such as a Lambda function or an Amazon EC2 instance.</li>
<li><b>Security policy:</b> The security policy controls the permissions that an Amazon API Gateway API has to access AWS resources.</li>
<li><b>API plan:</b> An API plan is a set of resources and limits that determine access to the API and the use of API resources.</li>
</ul>

<details><summary><h3>Best practices</h3></summary>

Some best practices for using Amazon API Gateway include:
<ul>
  <li>Designing simple and easy-to-use APIs following RESTful standards</li>
  <li>Using proper authentication to secure the API against unauthorized access, such as using access tokens and API keys</li>
  <li>Implementing a rate limit to limit the number of requests that can be made to the API in a given period of time</li>
  <li>Using compression to reduce the size of API responses, improving its performance</li>
  <li>Using API caching to reduce latency and the number of calls to the backend infrastructure</li>
  <li>Managing and monitoring API logs for troubleshooting and debugging</li>
  <li>Using versioning and access control options to track and manage changes to APIs</li>
  <li>Configuring access control policies to limit access to the API and its resources</li>
  <li>Using monitoring resources, such as Amazon CloudWatch, to monitor and analyze the API's performance and efficiency</li>
  <li>Testing and validating the API before deploying it in production</li>
</ul>
